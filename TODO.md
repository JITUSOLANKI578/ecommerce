## Tasks to Complete:

1. [x] Update backend/package.json with proper seeding scripts
2. [x] Enhance backend/src/seeders/seedData.js with better error handling and options
3. [ ] Create a unified seeding approach that can handle different data types
4. [x] Add proper command-line arguments for selective seeding
5. [ ] Test the seeding functionality
6. [ ] Update documentation

## Current Status:
